Reflective Earth is on a mission to slow global warming as fast and safely as
possible by increasing Earth's reflectivity to reduce its energy imbalance.
Reflectivity interventions reduce the amount of sunlight absorbed by the Earth
system, i.e. the amount of energy entering the system. Deploying reflective
materials as a stop gap could limit the amount of warming experienced by people
and buy society time to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and drawdown atmospheric
greenhouse gas concentrations.

The potential of reflective materials to reflect sunlight strongly depends on
location. The amount of incoming solar radiation varies greatly, with more
being received in the tropics and less being received at the poles. Clouds,
water vapor, and aerosols (e.g. dust, smoke) scatter and absorb sunlight. These
properties vary spatially as well.

This code repository contains workflows to estimate the potential of Earth's
surface to reflect incoming sunlight back out to space. We use data from the
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fifth generation
reanalysis product (ERA5) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Energy Balanced
and Filled (EBAF) satellite-derived product, specifically radiative fluxes at
the surface and top of atmosphere. This allows us to estimate surface
reflectance and atmospheric transmittance and reflectance. When averaged over
several decades, these properties can be combined with incoming solar radiation
and surface albedo to model the potential surface-reflected outgoing solar
radiation:

## Developer Setup

1. Clone and change directory to the reflective-potential repo.
   * `git clone https://github.com/ReflectiveEarth/reflective-potential.git`
   * `cd reflective-potential`
2. Create and activate the `conda`/`mamba` environment corresponding to the
   notebook you would like to run.
   * e.g. environment for `01-ingest.ipynb`
     * `{conda | mamba} env create --file environment/{linux | macos}.ingest.environment.yml`
     * `conda activate ingest`
3. Launch Jupyter Lab.
   * `jupyter lab`
4. Open and run the  notebooks in the eponymous directory.
   * *N.B.* additional setup may be required. See the *Preliminaries* section of
     each notebook.

### Prerequisites
