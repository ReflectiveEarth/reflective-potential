## Questions

Ask questions by starting a new discussion on the project's
[Discussions][discussions] tab. First, choose **Q&A**
as the discussion category. Then put your question in the thread title,
include some supporting information in the body text, and click the **Start
discussion** button to ask for support.

### Asking quality questions

If you take care to frame your question with context and detail, it will be much
easier for the community to provide support. Consider including answers
to the following prompts in your post asking for help:

* What are you trying to do with `reflective-potential`?
* What problem have you encountered and what steps have you taken to try to
  resolve it yourself (e.g. [rubber duck debugging][rubberduck])?
* What steps can we take to reproduce your problem?
* What operating system version and python version are you running?
* Can you provide a link to a screen recording (e.g. [Loom][loom]) demonstrating
  the problem?

The more time you invest providing us with context and detail, the better we can
help you.
