### Asking quality questions

If you take care to frame your question with context and detail, it will be much easier for us
to provide you with support. Consider including answers to the following prompts in your note
asking for help:

* What are you trying to do with `reflective-potential`?
* What problem have you encountered and what steps have you taken to try to resolve it yourself (e.g. [rubber duck debugging][rubberduck])?
* What steps can we take to reproduce your problem?
* What operating system version and python version are you running?
* Can you provide a link to a screen recording (e.g. [Loom][loom]) demonstrating the problem?

The more time you invest providing us with context and detail, the better we can help you.
